# WiiLink Patcher (Experimental C# Version)

WiiLink Patcher is a program made for easier installation of WiiLink. With it, you can just sit back and relax while the patcher does everything for you.

It utilizes [Sharpii-NetCore](https://github.com/TheShadowEevee/Sharpii-NetCore) to download channel contents, and patches them with [Xdelta3](https://github.com/jmacd/xdelta), to create the patched WADs that you can install on your Wii, and use with WiiLink24!

>As this patcher is experimental, it may contain bugs. If you spot any or are just having problems with the patcher in general, report them on our [Issues Page](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink24-Patcher/issues), or ask us for help on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wiilink)!

>If you wish to compile this yourself, clone or download the repository, and open the solution file in Visual Studio. You will need to make sure you have .NET 6.0 set up to compile it.
